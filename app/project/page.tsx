          Secondary market properties are pre-owned properties that are ready for immediate
occupancy or rental. These properties are typically sold at market value, offering buyers a
chance to acquire completed homes or commercial spaces without waiting for construction.
For investors, secondary market properties can provide more immediate returns and are often
viewed as a more stable investment.
